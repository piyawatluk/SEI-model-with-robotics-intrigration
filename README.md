# SEI-model-with-robotics-intrigration
when adjust all variable. the value shouldn't be above 1 and below or equal 0 
except for P and n variable

*** remark that variable name is based on SEI function which are:
            dSdt = -beta * S * I * delta
            dEdt = beta * S * I * delta - alpha * E
            dIdt = alpha * E - gamma * I
            
    express inform of differential equation
